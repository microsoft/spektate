# Spektate

This is an initiative to visualize [Project Bedrock](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock). Spektate ties in information from the repositories API, the pipelines API and information stored in an Azure Table to display the dashboard with the following components:

Here's a detailed diagram describing the Spektate workflow. Each pipeline is responsible for sending a unique set of data to the storage, which is used to connect all the pieces together:

Currently, Spektate consists of a command line interface and a simple dashboard prototype. The instructions to use both are below.

Note: Spektate dashboard will delete deployments when their corresponding builds/releases have expired in Azure DevOps.

## Onboard a Bedrock project to use Spektate

Follow the steps in this [guide](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/blob/master/docs/service-introspection-onboarding.md) to onboard a project to use Spektate.

## Dashboard prototype

1. Clone this repository, and run `yarn`.
2. Add the following env variables to your shell:

   ```bash
   export REACT_APP_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=
   export REACT_APP_STORAGE_TABLE_NAME=
   export REACT_APP_STORAGE_PARTITION_KEY=
   export REACT_APP_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=
   export REACT_APP_PIPELINE_PROJECT=
   export REACT_APP_PIPELINE_ORG=
   export REACT_APP_PIPELINE_ACCESS_TOKEN=
   export REACT_APP_MANIFEST=
   export REACT_APP_MANIFEST_ACCESS_TOKEN=
   export REACT_APP_SOURCE_REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN=
   ```

   - `REACT_APP_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`: Access key for the storage account
   - `REACT_APP_STORAGE_TABLE_NAME`: Table name for the storage account
   - `REACT_APP_STORAGE_PARTITION_KEY`: Partition key for your configuration, you may want to use project name or some identifier that helps separate unrelated configurations for the purpose of introspection.
   - `REACT_APP_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`: Storage account name
   - `REACT_APP_PIPELINE_PROJECT`: Project name for the pipelines in Azure DevOps
   - `REACT_APP_PIPELINE_ORG`: Org name for the pipelines in Azure DevOps
   - `REACT_APP_PIPELINE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Access token for pipelines in Azure DevOps
   - `REACT_APP_MANIFEST`: Manifest repository name
   - `REACT_APP_MANIFEST_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Access token for the manifest repository
   - `REACT_APP_SOURCE_REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Access token for the source repository
   - **Note**: If you're using GitHub, add `REACT_APP_GITHUB_MANIFEST_USERNAME`: Account name under which the manifest repository resides.

3. Then run `yarn start` to view the dashboard for the hello world deployment screen.
